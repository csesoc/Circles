## MVP Goals for Showcase 1 (FE)
* User can select their degree (single and double), majors and minors
* User can see all the courses relating to their degree
* User can search through all available UNSW courses
* User can add a degree to their Term Planner, given they have achieved the pre-requisites
* User can see the courses that a selected degree is required for - "Next courses"
* User can visualise their term planner in a year form
* User can drag and drop courses from one term to another term in their year planner
* User can add or remove a year from their year planner
* User can see a dashboard with statistics of their degree completion status

 

## Workflow
1. Create Pull Request to `dev` branch
2. Tag relevant reviewers
3. Make a comment which describes clearly what your commit does - you can even link it to a particular Jira Ticket 
4. Once approved without any requests to change, SQUASH AND MERGE 

Notes: 
* A PR can be uncomplete! That is ok. A PR can be a work in progress and basically allows us (Team Leads) to follow up and be able to give feedback on your work.
* Aim to have PRs LESS than 300 lines. It should be a request to have a SINGLE feature. 
* Don't try to mix and mash lots of different changes into your PR. If your issue is addressing two problems, create two PRs.
* Don't commit `package-lock.json` or `.vscode`
